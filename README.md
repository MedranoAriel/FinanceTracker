FINANCE TRACKER

--This is more kind of what i would write on a post than on a readme, but...--

This an app created to learn and to give me (and my mother) a tool to get
financial information about the income/expenses month to month. Thus, have more 
clarity and take better decisions.

I've been working in finance for a lot of time (+10 years), so i know there are 
a lot of variables, but it doesn't need to so complicated. I'll start with the 
basics.

I know this is easier to do with AI, but i want to do it myself to force to 
think a lot of options (maybe i'll use AI to help summarize info or check things)
